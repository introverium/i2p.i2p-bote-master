<h2>Ce este o Identitate?</h2>
<p>An Identity is like an email account, but without a provider - you control your account, instead of a third party like Google or Yahoo.</p>

<h2>Ce este o destinație?</h2>
<p>A Destination is the address that you give to your friends so they can send you emails.</p>

<h2>De ce este adresa de email așa de lungă?</h2>
<p>Every email is automatically encrypted by Bote. Each address contains a set of public keys, which are used to encrypt emails sent to that address. The length of the address depends on the type of encryption used.</p>

<h2>Există o limită a numărului de identități pe care le pot avea?</h2>
<p>Puteți creea cât de multe identități doriți și puteți utiliza diferite identități pentru diferite scopuri.</p>

<h2>Când expiră identitățile?</h2>
<p>Never. As long as you have the private keys for an Identity, you can use it. This also means that there is no "account recovery" - if you lose your phone, you lose your Identities.</p>
<p>You can back up your Identities by exporting them from the "Settings" menu. This will save a copy of them to a file in your phone's storage. The file can be used to recover your Identities, or move them to another device.</p>
