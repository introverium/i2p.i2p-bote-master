Silent Store approval checks to confirm/implement:
- Known Vulnerabilities
  - Apps will be tested to ensure that they are not susceptible to known
    publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. For example:
    - Heartbleed
    - Poodle
    - MasterKey
    - Common Path Traversal attacks
    - Common SQL Injection attacks
- Network Security Protocols
  - All Apps that require transmission of data from the App to a system that
    does not exist on the device must use, at a minimum, TLS1.1 standards.
    However, Blackphone would prefer the usage of TLS1.2.
  - Apps must not use algorithms for cryptographic purposes that are considered
    obsolete or outdated i.e. MD5, SHA1, RC4, DES, or any encryption algorithm
    that is weaker than AES128.
- Transport Layer Protection
  - All network communication should be encrypted
  - Not vulnerable to SSl Strip
- Data Leakage
  - No storage of sensitive data outside of application sandbox
  - Files should not be created with MODE_WORLD_READABLE or MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE
  - Copy & Paste will be evaluated on a case by case basis
  - App logs should not contain sensitive information
- Authentication and Authorization
  - Validate that authentication credentials are not stored on the device
  - Must use an approved password-based key derivation function ie. PBKDF2, scrypt
- Data-at-rest Encryption
  - Must use at a minimum AES128 with modes CCM or GCM
  - Should not store the encryption key on the file system
- Permission Checks
  - The App must function with all permissions disabled
  - Apps must not hard crash if a permission is disabled
  - Apps should ask users to enable permissions that are disabled if needed to
    function properly and explain why the permission is necessary
- Privacy Policy
  - Apps must have a privacy policy that details how customer data is used,
    stored, shared, etc...
  - Apps must be configured with the customer opted out by default
  - App logs should not contain PII
- Error Handling
  - Apps should follow best-practices for error handling and logging
