<p>I2P-Bote is an easy-to-use, highly anonymous secure e-mail application for
I2P. It is a serverless, fully decentralized system that establishes/forms a
peer-to-peer network built on top of state-of-the-art low latency anonymizing
network I2P; adding to it an optional mixminion-like high-latency transport and
thus avoiding the shortcomings of low-latency networks.</p>

<p>Therefore, I2P-Bote makes full use of the anonymity provided by I2P, plus it
generates its own anonymity by adding another anonymizing layer (overlay
network).</p>

<p>This concept of layered anonymity is what makes I2P-Bote so flexible: you
can configure it to be extremely anonymous and slow, or less anonymous
but faster/more efficient. In any event, I2P-Bote always provides a very good
anonymity for both, sender and receiver, as well as end-to-end encryption.
Unless you send e-mails to or receive them from the regular internet, ALL
emails - the mail body, attachments and the header except recipient's address
(subject, date, time, sender address, &hellip;) are automatically and transparently
end-to-end encrypted. The recipient's address is only visible for the mail
route's last node that stores the packets into the kad network, and the
respective storing nodes, but they cannot read the mail's content nor who sent
it nor who will fetch it.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote offers the option to make your communications even more anonymous,
by enabling the high-latency mail routes - at cost of performance, however.
Users that want their anonymous e-mails to arrive as quickly as possible, will
want to disable the mail routes and use 'direct' sending through I2P. It is
guaranteed that you will never be less anonymous than the anonymity provided by
standard I2P connections.</p>

<p>In order to achieve high usability, we have enabled it to be used with
standard mail clients such as Thunderbird, Evolution or Kmail, without having
to worry about what extra information these applications send in their headers.
Furthermore there is a web interface that lets you send and read e-mails or
manage your settings and identities.</p>

<h2 id="How-To">2. How to use I2P-Bote</h2>

<h3 id="Starting">2.1. Starting I2P-Bote</h3>
<p>After starting I2P-Bote (by default it is set to start automatically when
your I2P router starts up) it takes a bit more than three minutes for
everything to be up and running.</p>

<p>So have a look at 'Network Status' on the left. It should state
'Connected'.</p>

<p>If you want to use I2P-Bote for yourself, you first need to create an
identity.</p>

<h3 id="Creating-Identities">2.2. Creating an Identity</h3>
<p>Click on 'Identities' on the left, then hit the 'New Identity' button.</p>

<p>Enter at least a 'Public Name' and hit 'Create'. That's all that's needed to
create an identity.</p>

<p>The public name is the name you see for this identity (useful in case you
have different identities for different sets of users you communicate with or
different purposes) and it will be sent as 'sender's name' to the mail's
recipient. There is no need for Public Name to be unique.</p>

<p>(As you can choose any name here - anyone could call himself HungryHobo
there - it is not suited to be used by the recipient for telling if two mails
come from the same sender. This is why the name saved in the local addressbook
(there can only be one name per destination key) is displayed, if there is any,
and you will see a green mark in the "Know" column, stating it is the
locally known name. If there is no entry for a destination in local
addressbook, the name specified by the sender will be displayed with a prefixed
{UNK} in the mail clients).</p>

<p>You can also fill out the other fields, if you like:</p>

<p>Description - this field is kept locally. It's just for your convenience:
If you want to add some additional information for yourself about that
identity, you can enter it here.</p>

<p>Email Address - this field is not used yet.</p>

<p>Choose one of the given encryption algorithms. If in doubt, stick to the
defaults.</p>

<p>You can click on the name of one of your identities and copy the long key
displayed under 'Email Destination'. This is your I2P-Bote e-mail address. If
you want anybody to be able to send you a bote mail, he need to be given this
long key.</p>

<p>Now you can send and receive I2P-Bote mails.</p>

<p>But you should also have a look at your I2P-Bote settings and see if they
fit your needs.</p>

<p>(You can also create various identities and assign different settings to
each of them.)</p>

<h3 id="Sending-Receiving">2.3. Sending and Receiving E-Mails</h3>
<p>You need to have the I2P-Bote e-mail destination key of the user you to whom
you want to send a bote mail.</p>

<p>In order to send a message, click on 'New', choose your own sender identity
or 'Anonymous' under 'From' and enter the recipient's e-mail destination key
or alternatively an address in the 'To:' line.</p>

<p>(Alternatively, you can hit the 'Addr. Book' button right under this very
line, in order to choose from e-mail dests stored locally in your address book:
Mark the user(s) to which you want your mail to be sent and hit the 'Add
Recipients' button.)</p>

<p>You can add several recipients and change the 'To:' to 'CC:' or 'BCC:'.</p>

<p>The '+' button adds additional recipient lines.</p>

<p>Now write your bote mail and hit 'Send' for sending it, or 'Save' in order
to store it as a draft into your 'drafts' folder or any user-defined folder.
[not yet implemented]</p>

<p>Hitting 'Send' will place your e-mail into the Outbox folder and you can
go on using I2P-Bote, e.g. writing another e-mail, or simply do other things.
I2P-Bote is now sending your e-mail. Once it is sent, it's automatically
removed from Outbox and stored into your Sent folder. This means, your mail is
entirely on the way to its destination (unless you have set a delay time, which
is disabled by default).</p>

<p>In I2P-Bote e-mails are automatically signed (unless send without any sender
identity).</p>

<p>You can also send e-mails without specifying <em>any</em> sender
identity/destination/address, just select 'Anonymous' in the scroll-down
menu 'From:'.</p>

<p>In the default settings I2P-Bote will automatically check for new mails, and
all you need to do in order to see if you got e-mails is look into your Inbox
(link 'Inbox' on the left).</p>

<p>You can force a manual check by clicking the 'Check Mail' button. This is a
global checking, that tries to fetch new mails for all of your identities,
except for those you have excluded from global checking. [not yet
implemented]</p>

<p>The number of unread e-mails is shown in parenthesis next to the folder's
name in the sidebar.</p>

<p>Click on 'Inbox' to have a list of received e-mails displayed. You will see
two columns with x's or green checks. Those show you if a mail contains a valid
signature and is thus authentic (Sig) and if the sender's e-mail destination
key is locally known, i.e. in your addressbook (Know). Hence, two green checks
next to a mail entry mean that you already know that e-mail identity and that
the mail is signed by that identity.</p>

<p>If you have a certain name in your address book and you get a mail from an
identity with that name, yet Know is <em>not</em> displaying a green check,
then it is a <em>different</em> destination that sent and signed this mail; he
simply has chosen the same name you have chosen for one of your contacts.</p>

<p>Is there a green check mark for 'Sig', then the mail is correctly signed
by the sender and you may add it to your addressbook under a different name,
which now will be displayed as the sender.</p>

<p>Of course, a mail without sender destination ('Anonymous' is displayed as
sender) will have two x's.</p>

<p>Clicking one of the e-mails displayed in your inbox will open the mail.</p>

<p>The same applies to all other folders.</p>

<p>(Due to the distributed nature of I2P-Bote, sending as well as checking for
and retrieving e-mails takes a few minutes. With mail routes activated
respectively more. But you need not keep the browser open for that, simply
leave I2P-Bote running as a background process - this also benefits your
anonymity.)</p>

<h3 id="Address-Book">2.4. Local Address Book</h3>
<p>If you have the I2P-Bote e-mail key from somebody you want to write to more
frequently, it is handy to store that key locally into your address book (link
on the left), specify a name of your own choosing for this contact and paste
his mail destination in the corresponding line, then save.</p>

<p>You should normally save destinations to your address book, so that next time
you get a mail from the same sender it will be shown to be from the same,
locally known sender ('Loc' is checked) and a mail sent by someone else who
is just using the same user name will be marked as NOT known locally (an x in
web-UI's 'Know' column or {UNK} before the sender address in IMAP), so you know
it's a new/different one.</p>

<h3 id="Settings">2.5. Settings (and what they mean)</h3>
<p>Under settings you can choose the I2P-Bote interface's <em>language</em>
(currently English or German) and decide whether even with a non-English
language setting everything that will be automatically added to an e-mail when
replying will nonetheless stay in English, so that the recipient does not know
your I2P-Bote is set to a different language. Otherwise the recipient could
guess about your nationality which would decrease your anonymity.</p>

<p>Here you can also adjust the interval for <em>automatic checking</em> of
e-mails and decide whether or not to send any <em>time stamp</em> with your
mails, indicating date and time when the mail was sent. The time stamps are
always in UTC.</p>

<p>(When using mail routes, the timestamps are automatically disabled.) [not
yet implemented]</p>

<p>automatic checking for e-mails:</p>

<p>For more comfort there is the 'Check for mail every XX minutes'
option.</p>

<p>Here you can specify how often your I2P-Bote app should try to fetch unread
mails for your identities. This can be set on a per-identity basis [not yet
implemented]</p>

<p>If you specify a random offset, then it will not check _exactly_ every XX
minutes, but rather every (XX+-offset*XX) minutes, i.e. after a randomly chosen
time between (1-offset)XX minutes and (1+offset)XX minutes. [not yet
implemented]</p>

<p>You can also totally disable the automatic checking for a given
identity.</p>

<p>(If you are not sure about these settings, the defaults should be ok for
you.)</p>

<p><em>Mail routes</em> are chains of I2P-Bote nodes acting as relays/routers for
other peers and obeying to per-hop delays, thus providing the high-latency
transport for increased anonymity.</p>

<p>You can specify the number of nodes (here called hops) that should be
chained to form a mail route. Then each of the e-mail packets sent by the
identity that has mail routes enabled will go through a mail route of n hops
before being stored. You can set a delay for each hop individually, as no hop
should know the time a packet will wait at the next hop, making the timing
unpredictable. [individual per-hop and per-identity setting of delays not yet
implemented]</p>

<p>As delay you can specify a time frame (e.g. 60-600 minutes) - then a
random wait time between the two values will be chosen for the packet at that
hop - or a fix time, then the packet will be forwarded at that fix time, e.
g. noon UTC, no matter when it arrived. [fix time not yet implemented]</p>

<p>(When using mail routes, the timestamps are automatically disabled.) [not yet
implemented]</p>

<p>Under <em>Mixing anonymity</em> (minimum threshold number of relay
packets that will be sent) you can specify a threshold. As your node can only
act reliably as a mix if there are enough foreign packets to mix and to blend
own packets with, it will accumulate messages whose delay time is over until
reaching this lower limit. Only when it is surpassed, your node starts sending
them out in random order. [Not yet implemented]</p>

<p><em>exclude identity from global checking</em> [Not yet implemented]</p>

<p>If you enable this option for one of your identities, then this one will not
be affected by the global manual checking for mails nor by any global automatic
mail checking.</p>

<h3 id="Gateway">2.6. E-mails to and from the Internet</h3>
<p>[NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED!]</p>

<p>In order to be able to send bote mails to the internet and to receive
e-mails from the internet with your I2P-Bote application, you must first
register with an appropriate mail gateway. Currently there is only one:
postman.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, go to
<a href="http://hq.postman.i2p/?page_id=16">http://hq.postman.i2p/?page_id=16</a>
and register an account. If you already have an account or if you have just
created one as described, proceed with #2.</p></li>

<li><p>For an existing account you can add your I2P-Bote mail destination, so
that e-mails coming from the internet are forwarded to your I2P-Bote app. To do
so go to
<a href="http://hq.postman.i2p/?page_id=74">http://hq.postman.i2p/?page_id=74</a>
and provide the requested information.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now all e-mails sent to that address
(<a href="mailto:name@i2pmail.org">name@i2pmail.org</a> from the outer internet
or <a href="mailto:name@mail.i2p">name@mail.i2p</a> for mails from other postman
subscribers) will be forwarded via the I2P-Bote network to your I2P-Bote
app.</p>

<p>(N.B. When using the <a href="mailto:name@mail.i2p">name@mail.i2p</a> or
<a href="mailto:name@i2pmail.org">name@i2pmail.org</a> addresses instead of the
long addresses, e-mails are no longer end-to-end encrypted. Therefore, it is
recommended to exchange the I2P-Bote mail destination keys for communicating
within the network. Postman has offered high quality services in I2P for quite
a while already, but be aware that it's a centralized point that might go
offline one day, or worse be taken over by an evildoer that will manipulate
mails. As for network-internal e-mail communication, I2P-Bote makes sure that
if you use the address keys, nobody can tamper with the mails you send or
receive.)</p>

<p>If you want not only to receive e-mails from the internet, but also enable
sending e-mails from I2P-Bote to the internet, you must provide your I2P-Bote
client with the gateway's mail destination key, so that your I2P-Bote knows
where to send those mails to.</p>

<p>You can do this under 'Settings'. This gateway will allow I2P-Bote users
to communicate with the standard e-mail users on the internet as well as with
users of postman's classical i2pmail service (@mail.i2p).</p>

<p>In order to fight abuse, there will be a limitation of the number of e-mails
you can send out to the internet; just like for normal postman mail service
users: If an I2P-Bote user exceeds the quota with outgoing e-mails, the
additional e-mails will be sent back as bounce.</p>

<h2 id="Considerations">3. Considerations about Anonymity</h2>
<p>Don't send identifying information about you (name, address, geographic
location, time zone, age, websites you have just visited or blogged about, user
names, ip numbers, I2P router id, I2P-Bote id, social security number, credit
card number, &hellip;, copies of your passport, driver's license, home rental
contract, photos (nude or with clothes), documents that contain your
username in author's settings, and many many more)!</p>

<p>If possible,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>leave I2P-Bote running 24/7,</p></li>
<li><p>use mailroutes with randomized per-hop delays and/or per-hop fixed send
times, [not yet <em>fully</em> implemented]</p></li>
<li><p>use a long check interval,</p></li>
<li><p>use a long local delay for own packets,</p></li>
<li><p>use a big check interval randomization. [not yet implemented]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can suppress the sending of date and time in the e-mails' header.</p>

<p>When you reply to an e-mail, certain markers are added to show the recipient
that this is a reply, such as 'Re: [subject of the mail you're replying to]' or
'[username] wrote:'. Those are different for the languages you can chose from in
your language settings. However, if you don't want the recipient to know what
language you have set, you can suppress translation of these markers, so that
they will be in English, no matter what you language setting is. In order to do
so, mark 'Use English for text added to outgoing email ('Re:', 'wrote:',
etc.)'</p>

<p>Be careful with the contents you send! Don't include personal information or
information that only you can possess. Don't write 'I'm going to bed now, it's
late' when including time stamps.</p>

<p>The language in which you write your e-mails, your style and formulations
can also be of interest for an attacker.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote also offers the possibility to use different e-mail identities.
Suppose one of you contacts learns about your identity, as you forgot to erase
identifying information in a secret document you have sent to him. Now if this
e-mail's recipient was to collaborate with others you are in contact with, he
could tell them the real world identity belonging to the Bote address he knows
from you. Thusly, if you communicate with those others using the same Bote
address, they will know who you are. Not so, if you used a different address
for sending mails to them.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">4. Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="Unlimited-Strength-Crypto">4.1. Notification about JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files</h3>
<p>If you have a notification at the bottom of your screen about JCE Unlimited
Strength Jurisdiction Policy files, it means that your Java installation is
restricted from using the strong cryptography that I2P-Bote requires.</p>

<p>You can enable the strong cryptography by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle's website</a>. You may need to use your regular browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip the downloaded zip file.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the files <code>local_policy.jar</code> and <code>US_export_policy.jar</code> into the folder shown in the notification on your screen. Overwrite any existing files with the same names.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart I2P.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some countries have restrictions on the allowed strengths of cryptographic
software. If you are unsure about the restrictions in your country, consult
with a lawyer.</p>

<h2 id="Technical-Concept">5. Technical Concept</h2>
<p>I2P-Bote is an end-to-end encrypted, network-internal, fully decentralized
(i.e. serverless) e-mail system. It supports different identities and does not
expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is still alpha software. It can be
accessed via web console, and it has IMAP and SMTP support, so bote-mails can
be read and written by regular email clients. It is planned to guarantee
additional anonymity by providing a high-latency transport option. All
bote-mails are automatically end-to-end encrypted, so that there's no need to
set up extra e-mail encryption (though you can do that), and bote-mails will be
authenticated automatically. As it is decentralized, there is no e-mail server
that could link different e-mail identities as communicating with each other
(<em>profiling</em>): Even the nodes relaying the mails will not know the sender
and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail
tunnel and the storing nodes will know to whom (anonymous identity) the mail is
destined. The original sender can have gone offline long before the mail
becomes available on the other side. This adds on the degree of anonymity that
can be reached with I2P-Bote. For those who do not want high delays: All these
settings are user-adjustable, so each user decides on how much anonymity he
wants.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote nodes store encrypted e-mails into a Kademlia DHT. Therefore, an
e-mail can be sent through a number of other nodes (relays) for increased
security, or directly to a set of storage nodes for faster delivery. The same
applies to retrieving email.</p>

<p>(When using mail routes, timestamps are automatically disabled.) [Retrieving
via relays not yet implemented]</p>

<p>All nodes are created equal: There are no 'supernodes' or designated
relay/storage nodes. Everybody acts as a potential relay and storage node. The
maximum amount of disk space used for relayed/stored email packets can be
configured by the user.</p>

<p>Before an email is sent to a relay, it is broken up into packets and
encrypted with the recipient's public key. These packets are stored redundantly
in a distributed hash table (DHT).</p>

<p>They are kept for at least 100 days, during which the recipient can download
them.</p>

<p>Relay packets also expire after 100 days or more.</p>

<p>If a node runs out of email storage space, and there are no old packets that
can be deleted, the node refuses storage requests.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I2P-Bote sanitizes the mail headers and does not allow any
unneeded information to be transmitted, thus allowing the use of e-mail clients
without prior checks of what this client sends in the mail headers.</p>

<p>All the encryption, path choosing and profiling is done locally so that
there is no trusted party involved.</p>

<p>Not even for bootstrapping I2P-Bote depends on a central node, as it uses
Seedless.</p>

<p>Using I2P-Bote appropriately, that means keeping in mind the considerations
given above and showing some common sense, nobody will be able to find out who
or where you are. And if you are already being observed and your internet
connection sniffed, the observer will not be able to find out what you send or
receive or to whom you are sending to or receiving from or where your contacts
are located.</p>

<p>Let's go a bit more into detail:</p>

<h3>What I2P-Bote <em>does hide</em>:</h3>

<p>I2P-Bote hides both, the identity and location of sender and receiver, as
well as those of intermediary nodes (relays and storing nodes), the content of
your mails, their size, the number of mails you send.</p>

<p>Only the recipient can know the sender's bote mail destination, and if he
choses not to send his destination, not even the recipient will know it.</p>

<p>Even if you send time stamps, your time zone will not be disclosed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I2P-Bote hides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the fact that you run I2P-Bote</p></li>
<li><p>the fact that you send a mail</p></li>
<li><p>the fact that you receive a mail</p></li>
<li><p>the time you send a mail</p></li>
<li><p>the time you receive a mail</p></li>
<li>
<p>the upper limit of number of mails an unknown user receives</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an abstract user, no concrete one, just concluding its existence from
the existence of the mail identity as he could always have more than one e-mail
identity</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>the lower limit, as an identity also sends out test and dummy messages</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What I2P-Bote <em>hides partially</em>:</h3>

<p>The I2P-Bote address of the recipient will only be known to sender and
recipient(s).</p>

<p>In case of multiple recipients, each one will see all other recipients that
the mail was addressed to via 'To:' or 'CC:'</p>

<p>All entries that were under 'BCC:' will only be visible to the sender and
this very recipient.</p>

<p>The sent time will, if at all, only be visible to sender and
recipient.</p>

<h3>What I2P-Bote <em>can hide optionally</em>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If mail routes are used, the time a bote mail is sent</p></li>
<li><p>If mail routes are used, the time a bote mail is fetched. [not yet
implemented]</p></li>
<li><p>If the sender suppresses timestamps only the sender himself will know when
he sent a mail.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What I2P-Bote <em>cannot hide</em>:</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote cannot hide the frequency a given identity checks for new mails nor
the number of mails a given identity receives.</p>

<h2 id="Technical-Details">6. Technical Details</h2>
<p>See techdoc.txt</p>

<h2 id="Terminology">7. Terminology/Glossary of Terms</h2>

<h3>I2P-Bote (router/node) id:</h3>
<p>This is the id an I2P-Bote router is known as. It is used for contacting
this router, for storing, relaying and fetching mails, but also used in the
hop-to-hop encryption and for simply contacting it via I2P, as it is at the
same the I2P-Bote router's I2P tunnel destination. It is displayed to represent
an I2P-Bote node in the stats.</p>

<p>So the router id corresponds to the I2P destination (the address of an
I2P-Bote node on the I2P network - there is no need to know it unless you are
having problems connecting to other I2P-Bote nodes).</p>

<h3>I2P-Bote e-mail destination:</h3>
<p>The I2P-Bote e-mail destination (key) is an identifier by which somebody can
be reached via I2P-Bote, so as the name states: an e-mail destination. Thus it
is for I2P-Bote what an e-mail address is for standard e-mail system: The
e-mail destination is the actual address for sending e-mails, for storing them
into and for fetching them from the DHT. At the same time it used for the
end-to-end encryption of e-mails, header information and attachments.</p>

<p>An I2P-Bote e-mail destination is a Base64 string containing a public
encryption key and a signature verification key. Example:</p>

<p>I2P-Bote router/node id and I2P-Bote e-mail destinations look similar, but
are completely independent of each other.</p>

<h3>E-mail address:</h3>
<p>E-mail addresses in I2P-Bote are shortcuts for e-mail destinations.</p>

<p>The e-mail address &lt;--&gt; e-mail destination mappings are stored in two
places: the local address book and the distributed address directory [the
latter not yet implemented].</p>

<h3>I2P-Bote e-mail identity:</h3>
<p>The I2P-Bote e-mail identity is a set of an I2P-Bote e-mail destination key,
the corresponding private keys and a name given to it by the user. This name
will be sent with the destination key if you do not suppress sending
information about the sender.</p>

<p>However it will only be displayed for the recipient in case he does not have
a name for this destination in his local address book.</p>

<p>So technically speaking, an e-mail identity consists of four things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an e-mail destination (i.e. two public keys)</p></li>
<li><p>two private keys for the e-mail destination</p></li>
<li><p>a public name which can be shown to other people in e-mails</p></li>
<li><p>a description which is not shown to anybody but you (it helps you remember
which e-mail identity you use for which purpose).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An e-mail identity is not required for sending emails (although then only
'Anonymous' can be selected for the 'sender' field).</p>

<h3>Mail routes:</h3>
<p>Mail routes are an additional high-latency transport for I2P-Bote. For this,
a chain of I2P-Bote nodes is built, acting as relays/routers for packets and
obeying to individual per-hop delays. [still no individual setting for delays
implemented]</p>

<p><strong>BEWARE!</strong> If you choose this option - especially with many
hops and / or long delay times, don't be surprised if your mail does not reach
its destination too soon. It will, of course, take longer - up to several days!</p>
